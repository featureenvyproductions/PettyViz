/* this is a project I started while unemployed because if i don't work I die.
 * this isn't a labor of love it's a labor of HATE
 * inspired by that time i was forced to use tableau for a year and craved death every minute of it
 * and i am not done with this program, but i hope one day i will be so i will never
 * have to use tableau prep again
 * and maybe you won't have to either.
 * i'm doing my best here idk.
