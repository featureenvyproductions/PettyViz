# PettyViz

Project I started this month during some free time....
In progress. Intended to be simple library to generate queries for basic data operations.
For example...You want to do some basic renaming of columns, summing of columns, from a database.
This will have functionality to where you can outline the steps in a standardized format in a file and the query will be generated for you.
Basic class structure is here. Currently filling in the functionality.
